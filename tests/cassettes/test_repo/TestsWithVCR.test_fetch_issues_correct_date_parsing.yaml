        Description\r\n\r\nFollowing modules have been refactored\r\n* config.py\r\n*
        connections.py\r\n* base_director.py\r\n* continuous_director.py\r\n* discrete_director.py\r\n*

        media_pipe_tracker.py\r\n* tracker.py\r\n* yolo_tracker.py\r\n* utils.py\r\n\r\nThis
        PR''s purpose is to refactor the code without or minimal feature changes.
        The goal is to make the application run smoother and make it feel fast to
        run on most computers.\r\n\r\n## config.py\r\n* The config.yml is now loaded
        in config.py module making it exportable as CAMERA_CONFIG\r\n\r\n## utils.py\r\n*
        Termination handler: This is supposed to be a cleanup of threads, but it seems
        like tk''s event loop will bypass the termination and has their own termination
        handle, so this will be removed in favor of utilizing the tk''s event loop.\r\n\r\n##
        connections.py\r\n* Removed OperatorConnection, CommandConnection and functions
        consolidated into base connection class.\r\n* Added on_message function that
        will be called every time the connection class receives a message from the
        socket connection.\r\n\r\n## base_director.py\r\n* RM load_config\r\n* Isolate
        calculate_center_bounding_box to a util function\r\n\r\n## manual_interface.py\r\n*
        ManualInterface class now inherits TK class to make it easier to handle the
        class after instantiated. Note that this is not really being used at the moment,
        but it will make it less management during rearchitecting.\r\n* Director loop
        no longer uses a while loop in favor of reducing usage of threads and utilizing
        tk''s event loop.\r\n\r\n## basic_tracker.py\r\n* removed load_config\r\n*
        removed duplicate logic\r\n\r\n## keep_away_director.py\r\n* removed duplicate
        logic\r\n\r\n## tracker.py\r\n* video_buffer: this is a new param for initializing
        tracker class that will let the cv2 take multiple buffer or single buffer
        when processing. Default is 1, but this should be changed based on the resource
        you have on your laptop.\r\n* New config param: desired_width, desired_height.
        This is a new camera config attribute that can be reconfigured to resize the
        frame size on the GUI based on the camera that is attached. If the desired_height
        is not defined, the tracker class will automatically determine the height
        based on the shape of the image taken from the camera.\r\n* temporary implementation
        of thread that handles the updating of the gui with video frames. This is
        temporary because we should utilize the eventloop of tk.\r\n\r\nThe following
        modules received minor refactoring\r\n* continuous_director.py\r\n* discrete_director.py\r\n*
        mock_operator.py\r\n* publisher.py\r\n* keep_away_director.py\r\n* media_pipe_pose.py\r\n*
        media_pipe_tracker.py\r\n* yolo_tracker.py\r\n\r\n\r\n# Metrics\r\n- PR Confidence
